                <p> Chicken is the ubiquitous food of our era, crossing multiple cultural boundaries with ease.
                    With its mild taste and uniform texture, chicken presents an intriguingly blank canvas for 
                    the flavor palette of almost any cuisine. A generation of Britons is coming of age in the 
                    belief that chicken tikka masala is the national dish, and the same thing is happening

                    Rapid growth of the world population particularly after the 50s has exceeded 7.5 billion in 2019.
                    The biggest problem that comes along with this growth is food and nutrition problems. Chickenplays
                    a significant role in the solution to these problems. Annual worldwide chicken meat production 
                    reached 110 million tonnes. Chicken is estimated to be the most produced types of meat after 2020.

                    Beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef 
                    is obtained from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, 
                    fine-grained lean, bright red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy white, and 
                    well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft, porous, and red; the less desirable mature 
                    beef has hard white bones

                    Rapid growth of the world population particularly after the 50s has exceeded 7.5 billion in 2019.
                    The biggest problem that comes along with this growth is food and nutrition problems. Chickenplays
                    a significant role in the solution to these problems. Annual worldwide chicken meat production 
                    reached 110 million tonnes. Chicken is estimated to be the most produced types of meat after 2020.
