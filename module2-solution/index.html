            <p id="gold"><strong>Chicken</strong></p>
            <p id="chicken">
                Chicken is the ubiquitous food of our era, crossing multiple cultural boundaries with ease.
                With its mild taste and uniform texture, chicken presents an intriguingly blank canvas for
                the flavor palette of almost any cuisine. A generation of Britons is coming of age in the 
                belief that chicken tikka masala is the national dish, and the same thing is happening in 
                China with Kentucky Fried Chicken.
                <br>Rapid growth of the world population particularly after the â€˜50s has exceeded 7.5 billion 
                in 2019. The biggest problem that comes along with this growth is food and nutrition problems. 
                Chicken plays a significant role in the solution to these problems. Annual worldwide chicken meat 
                production reached 110 million tonnes. Chicken is estimated to be the most produced types of meat 
                after 2020.

        <div class="collon-2">
            <p id="brown"><strong>Beef</strong></p>
            <p id="meat">
                Beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef 
                is obtained from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, 
                fine-grained lean, bright red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy white, and
                well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft, porous, and red; the less desirable mature
                beef has hard white bones

            <p id="yellow"><strong>Sushi</strong></p>
            <p id="sushi">
                Sushi, a staple rice dish of Japanese cuisine, consisting of cooked rice flavoured with 
                vinegar and a variety of vegetable, egg, or raw seafood garnishes and served cold. 
                Restaurants specializing in sushi abound in Japan, where subtleties of preparation find a 
                discriminating clientele, and the dish has gained popularity in the United States and
                elsewhere (see also sashimi).
